%%  FUNCTION randn
% This function generates a sequence of numbers that are normally distributed with a mean of
% 0 and a standard deviation of 1. A simple representation of its syntax is
%  r = randn(m, n)
% where r = an m-by-n matrix of random numbers. The following formula can then be used to
% generate a normal distribution with a different mean (mn) and standard deviation (s),
%  rnormal = mn + s * randn(m, n)
